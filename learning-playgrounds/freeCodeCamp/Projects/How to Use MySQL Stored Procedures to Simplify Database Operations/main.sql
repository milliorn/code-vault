-- This SQL code snippet is used to retrieve data from the 'sales' table and create a stored procedure 'GenerateSalesReport' that generates a sales report based on the provided start and end dates.
-- Retrieve the total number of rows (records) from the 'sales' table.
SELECT count(*)

-- Create a stored procedure called 'GenerateSalesReport' that takes two input parameters: 'start_date' and 'end_date'.
CREATE PROCEDURE GenerateSalesReport (IN start_date DATE, IN end_date DATE) BEGIN -- Within the procedure, we will select the 'order_date', 'order_id', and 'total_amount' columns from the 'orders' table.
