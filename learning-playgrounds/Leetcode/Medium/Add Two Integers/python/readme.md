# Intuition

The problem involves adding two numbers represented as reversed linked lists. The digits are processed from least significant to most significant, allowing us to directly traverse the lists from head to tail. By simulating manual addition:

- We add corresponding digits from both lists along with any carry.
- A new linked list is built to store the resulting digits.

The approach works even if the linked lists have different lengths or if there's a carry remaining after processing all nodes.

# Approach

1. **Initialization**:

   - Use a `head` pointer to track the head of the result linked list.
   - Use a `current` pointer to construct the linked list incrementally.
   - Initialize a `carry` variable to handle sums greater than 9.

2. **Traverse the Linked Lists**:

   - Loop until both input linked lists are fully processed.
   - For each iteration:
     - Extract the current digit from each linked list (use 0 if a list is exhausted).
     - Compute the sum of the digits and the carry.
     - Create a new node with the resulting digit (`sum % 10`) and link it to the result list.
     - Update the carry (`sum // 10`) for the next iteration.
   - Move the input pointers (`l1` and `l2`) forward if they are not `None`.

3. **Handle Remaining Carry**:

   - After exiting the loop, if there's a carry left, create a new node for it and append it to the result list.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - Return the `head` of the result linked list.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**:

  - O(max(n, m)): The function traverses the longer of the two linked lists (`l1` or `l2`), which has a length of at most max(n, m).

- **Space Complexity**:
  - O(max(n, m)): The result linked list requires a new node for each digit, which corresponds to the maximum number of nodes in the input lists plus one additional node for a potential carry.

This approach avoids using extra data structures and directly constructs the result as a linked list, making it efficient and optimal for the problem constraints.
