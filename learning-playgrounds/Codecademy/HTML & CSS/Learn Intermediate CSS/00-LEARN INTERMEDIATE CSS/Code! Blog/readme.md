# Code! Blog

In this project, you will help update the home page for the Code! blog to make it accessible to all who visit. Most HTML and CSS code has been written for you, but certain additions to bolster the accessibility of the page are desperately needed.

To complete this project, you must be familiar with common CSS Accessibility standards and be able to apply them to the elements of the home page. If you need a refresher, take time to review the Accessibility lesson.
