# Learn Sass

## Why Learn Sass?

Sass is an easy-to-use styling language that helps reduce a lot of the repetition and maintainability challenges of traditional CSS. Learning Sass will not only let you scale styles when working on big web development projects, it will also make it much faster and more efficient to write reusable styles from scratch for smaller projects.

## Take-Away Skills

This course will teach you how to use nesting, variables, mixins, placeholders, and functions to write more expressive and reusable styles. At the end of the course, you will be able to transition a CSS codebase to SCSS and style multiple websites.

## Note on Prerequisites

We recommend you complete Learn CSS, particularly the basics of working with CSS selectors and visual rules, before taking this course.
