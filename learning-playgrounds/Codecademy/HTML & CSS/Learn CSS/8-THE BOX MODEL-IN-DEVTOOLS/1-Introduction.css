The Box Model in DevTools

View and edit an HTML element's box using Chrome DevTools.

Introduction

All HTML elements are boxes made up of four components: a content container, padding, border, and margin. In our Box Model Lesson we introduce these four properties and use them to position elements on a website. If you have not taken this lesson, we recommend you do so now, before continuing.

In this article, we will introduce how Google Chrome’s DevTools can be used to view the box around each element on a web page.

1. View Box Model Dimensions with DevTools
You can use Google Chrome’s DevTools to view the box around every element on a web page. To do this, click View > Developer > Developer Tools and navigate to the Elements tab.

Elements Tab

In this tab you can view all of the elements on the current page. From this view, you can select the element of interest, which will open a new column on the right side of DevTools. Select the tab labeled Computed on the top of the rightmost column.

Computed Tab

The selected element’s box should appear at the top of the pane. Hovering over each property of the box will cause the property to be highlighted in the web page.

If you know the element you want to inspect, going through all of the steps listed above is unnecessary. Instead, you can right click the element you want to observe and select the Inspect button. This will display DevTools on the right side of the browser with the element selected in the Elements tab. To view the element’s box, you can select the Computed tab.
