CSS SETUP AND SELECTORS

Multiple Classes

We can use CSS to select an HTML element’s class attribute by name.

So far, we’ve selected elements using only one class name per element. If every HTML element had a single class, all the style information for each element would require a new class.

Luckily, it’s possible to add more than one class name to an HTML element’s class attribute.

For instance, perhaps there’s a heading element that needs to be green and bold. You could write two CSS rules like so:

.green {
  color: green;
}

.bold {
  font-weight: bold;
}

Then, you could include both of these classes on one HTML element like this:

<h1 class="green bold"> ... </h1>

We can add multiple classes to an HTML element’s class attribute by separating them with a space. This enables us to mix and match CSS classes to create many unique styles without writing a custom class for every style combination needed.
