CSS SETUP AND SELECTORS

Specificity

Specificity is the order by which the browser decides which CSS styles will be displayed. A best practice in CSS is to style elements while using the lowest degree of specificity, so that if an element needs a new style, it is easy to override.

IDs are the most specific selector in CSS, followed by classes, and finally, tags. For example, consider the following HTML and CSS:

<h1 class="headline">Breaking News</h1>

h1 {
  color: red;
}

.headline {
  color: firebrick;
}

In the example code above, the color of the heading would be set to firebrick, as the class selector is more specific than the tag selector. If an ID attribute (and selector) were added to the code above, the styles within the ID selector’s body would override all other styles for the heading. The only way to override an ID is to add another ID with additional styling.

Over time, as files grow with code, many elements may have IDs, which can make CSS difficult to edit, since a new, more specific style must be created to change the style of an element.

To make styles easy to edit, it’s best to style with a tag selector, if possible. If not, add a class selector. If that is not specific enough, then consider using an ID selector.
