CSS GRID ESSENTIALS

Multiple Row Items

Using the CSS properties grid-row-start and grid-row-end, we can make single grid items take up multiple rows. Remember, we are no longer applying CSS to the outer grid container; weâ€™re adding CSS to the elements sitting inside the grid!

.item {
  grid-row-start: 1;
  grid-row-end: 3;
}

In this example, the HTML element of class item will take up two rows in the grid, rows 1 and 2. The values that grid-row-start and grid-row-end accept are grid lines.

Row grid lines and column grid lines start at 1 and end at a value that is 1 greater than the number of rows or columns the grid has. For example, if a grid has 5 rows, the grid row lines range from 1 to 6. If a grid has 8 columns, the grid row lines range from 1 to 9.

The value for grid-row-start should be the row at which you want the grid item to begin. The value for grid-row-end should be one greater than the row at which you want the grid item to end. An element that covers rows 2, 3, and 4 should have these declarations: grid-row-start: 2 and grid-row-end: 5.

It is possible for the value of grid-row-start to be greater than that of grid-row-end. Both properties can also each have negative values. Consult the documentation to learn more about how to use these features.
