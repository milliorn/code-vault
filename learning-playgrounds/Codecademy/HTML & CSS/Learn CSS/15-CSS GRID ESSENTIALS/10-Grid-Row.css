CSS GRID ESSENTIALS

Grid Row

We can use the property grid-row as shorthand for grid-row-start and grid-row-end. The following two code blocks will produce the same output:

.item {
  grid-row-start: 4;
  grid-row-end: 6;
}

.item {
  grid-row: 4 / 6;
}

This code should look similar to the way grid-template is shorthand for grid-template-rowsand grid-template-columns. In this case, the starting row goes before the “/“ and the ending row goes after it. Again, the ending row is exclusive; this grid item will occupy rows four and five.

When an item spans multiple rows or columns using these properties, it will also include the grid-gap if any exists. For example, if an item spans two rows of height 100 pixels and there is a ten-pixel grid-gap, then the item will have a total height of 210 pixels.
