CSS COLOR
Introduction to Color
CSS supports a wide variety of colors. These include named colors, like blue, black, and LimeGreen, along with colors described by a numeric value. Using a numeric system allows us to take advantage of the whole spectrum of colors that browsers support. In this lesson, we’re going to explore all the color options CSS offers.

Colors in CSS can be described in three different ways:

Named colors — English words that describe colors, also called keyword colors
RGB — numeric values that describe a mix of red, green, and blue
HSL — numeric values that describe a mix of hue, saturation, and lightness
