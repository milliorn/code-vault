            <p>“Common Cents Party, a hard-hitting acoustic punk/electronic four-piece from Atlanta, Georgia, combines
                an unleashed live performance with edgy lyrics, unforgettable hooks and well-studied synth-rock sounds.
                A must-see, must-hear new band.” -Screech Magazine</p>
            <!--
                Next, create an anchor element that links users to a list of the band’s upcoming shows.
                The href attribute for the anchor element should be set to shows.html.
                The text for the anchor could say “Here’s a list of upcoming shows”.
