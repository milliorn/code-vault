# Building a Personal Portfolio

Building a personal portfolio provides an immediate demonstration of your programming prowess for prospective employers. It’s important, therefore, that this webpage appears clean and well-organized. A user should easily understand a particular page’s content and navigate seamlessly through your different pages.

You will be making several different webpages so it’s perfectly ok, and even recommended, to take breaks after completing each page. Also keep in mind that we’re providing not only guidelines on a very specific design but also the CSS which has established fonts, spacing, etc. that work for this particular design. Feel free to add, remove, or modify any details on a given page.
