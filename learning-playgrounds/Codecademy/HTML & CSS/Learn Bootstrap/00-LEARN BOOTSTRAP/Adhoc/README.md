# Adhoc

Let’s make full use of our Bootstrap knowledge and its accompanying documentation to create a website for Adhoc, an office administration website. Check out Adhoc’s design spec for more information. You also have the option of not following the steps/design spec and creating a website of your own design!

We’ll be using the following image assets:

Adhoc logo.
jumbotron background.
experienced icon.
fun icon.
smart icon.
picture of Brian M. the CEO.
picture of Andy C. the CFO.
picture of Angela W. the COO.
picture of Amie S. the CTO.

Be ready to browse Bootstrap’s documentation. The steps provided will explain what you need to do, but it’s up to you to find out how to implement it. If you’re have difficulty locating the correct resource, check the hint for some helpful links.

Remember, as you code along, save your code in order to see your changes reflected in the browser!
