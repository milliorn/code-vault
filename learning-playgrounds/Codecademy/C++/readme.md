40 years ago, a Ph.D. student by the name of Bjarne Stroustrup tinkered around with the C programming language, which was and still is a language well-respected for its flexibility and low-level functionality. Little did he know, he created a new language that can now be found in:

Operating systems
Web browsers
Microcontrollers
Video games
And elsewhere!
Take-Away Skills
This course will start with the fundamental programming concepts before digging deeper into the more advanced C++ topics. You will build everything from a Harry Potter Sorting Hat to a program that can censor text!
