# Sorting With Control Flow

Great! Now we need to add the right logic to our method.

    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    numbers.reverse!
    puts numbers

In the example above, we create an array called numbers.
Then, we reverse the array. Like with .sort!, the exclamation mark means we modify the actual array.
Finally, we print out 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1.
