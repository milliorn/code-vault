# Accessing Hash Values

You can access values in a hash just like an array.

    pets = {
        "Stevie" => "cat",
        "Bowser" => "hamster",
        "Kevin Sorbo" => "fish"
    }

    puts pets["Stevie"]
    # will print "cat"

In the example above, we create a hash called pets.
Then we print cat by accessing the key "Stevie" in the pets hash.
