# Iterating Over Arrays

Iterating over arrays is easier than it looks.

    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    numbers.each { |element| puts element }

In the example above, we create an array called numbers with 5 elements.
Then we say, “Take this array and for each element, print it to the console.” As usual, we can use any placeholder name for the bit between two | | characters.
