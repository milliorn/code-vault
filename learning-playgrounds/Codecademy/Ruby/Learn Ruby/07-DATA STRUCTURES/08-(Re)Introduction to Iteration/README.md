# (Re)Introduction to Iteration

Remember when we covered loops and iterators? We could use a whole bunch of different methods for looping in a program. When we loop over an array or a hash, we say that we iterate over it.

Weâ€™ll be using the .each iterator to iterate over arrays and hashes in this section. Take a look at the code in the editor to see one example of how we might go about this.
