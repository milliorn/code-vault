# Adding to a Hash

We can add to a hash two ways: if we created it using literal notation, we can simply add a new key-value pair directly between the curly braces. If we used Hash.new, we can add to the hash using bracket notation:

    pets = Hash.new
    pets["Stevie"] = "cat"
    # Adds the key "Stevie" with the
    # value "cat" to the hash
