# More Methods, More Solutions

Great work!

We’ve often found we only want the key or value associated with a key/value pair, and it’s kind of a pain to put both into our block and only work with one. Can we iterate over just keys or just values?

This is Ruby. Of course we can.

Ruby includes two hash methods, .each_key and .each_value, that do exactly what you’d expect:

    my_hash = { one: 1, two: 2, three: 3 }

    my_hash.each_key { |k| print k, " " }
    # ==> one two three

    my_hash.each_value { |v| print v, " " }
    # ==> 1 2 3

Let’s wrap up our study of Ruby hashes and symbols by testing these methods out.
