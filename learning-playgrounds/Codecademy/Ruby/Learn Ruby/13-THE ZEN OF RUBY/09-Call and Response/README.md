# Call and Response

Remember when we mentioned that symbols are awesome for referencing method names? Well, .respond_to? takes a symbol and returns true if an object can receive that method and false otherwise. For example,

    [1, 2, 3].respond_to?(:push)

would return true, since you can call .push on an array object. However,

    [1, 2, 3].respond_to?(:to_sym)

would return false, since you canâ€™t turn an array into a symbol.
