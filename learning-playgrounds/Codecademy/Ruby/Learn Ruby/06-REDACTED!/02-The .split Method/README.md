# The .split Method

Next, we’ll want to divide the user’s input into individual words.

Ruby has a built-in method for this called .split; it takes in a string and returns an array. If we pass it a bit of text in parentheses, .split will divide the string wherever it sees that bit of text, called a delimiter. For example,

    text.split(", ")

tells Ruby to split up the string text whenever it sees a comma.
