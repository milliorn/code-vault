# Sorting the Hash

Great! We have a hash full of word / frequency key-value pairs. Now we need to figure out a way to get our information in the order we want it.

    colors = {
        "blue" => 3,
        "green" => 1,
        "red" => 2
    }

    colors = colors.sort_by do |color, count|
        count
    end
    colors.reverse!

In the example above, we first create a hash called colors that maps color strings to numbers.
Then, we sort colors into green, red, and blue, from smallest to largest by count. Just so you know, the .sort_by function returns an array of arrays, but thatâ€™s fine for our purposes.
Finally, we reverse the array order so that the colors with the largest counts are first.
Can you do the same thing with the frequencies hash?
