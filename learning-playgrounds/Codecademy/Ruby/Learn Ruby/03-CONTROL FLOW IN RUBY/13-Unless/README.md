# Unless

Good! Now let’s review the unless statement.

    problem = false
    print "Good to go!" unless problem

Remember, this is basically a short hand if statement. It will do whatever you ask unless the condition is true. In our example, problem is false, so we don’t have a problem. We print Good to go!
