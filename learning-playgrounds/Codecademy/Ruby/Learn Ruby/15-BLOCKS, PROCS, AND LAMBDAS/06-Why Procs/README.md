# Why Procs

Why bother saving our blocks as procs? There are two main advantages:

Procs are full-fledged objects, so they have all the powers and abilities of objects. (Blocks do not.)
Unlike blocks, procs can be called over and over without rewriting them. This prevents you from having to retype the contents of your block every time you need to execute a particular bit of code.
