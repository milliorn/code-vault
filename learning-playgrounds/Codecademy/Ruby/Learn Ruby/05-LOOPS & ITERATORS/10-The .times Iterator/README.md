# The .times Iterator

The .times method is like a super compact for loop: it can perform a task on each item in an object a specified number of times.

For example, if we wanted to print out "Chunky bacon!" ten times, we might type

    10.times { print "Chunky bacon!" }

We donâ€™t know why we would type that, but we could!
