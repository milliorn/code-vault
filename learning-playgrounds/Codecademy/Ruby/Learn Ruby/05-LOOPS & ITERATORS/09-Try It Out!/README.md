# Try It Out

Cool, no? Now itâ€™s your turn to take the .each method for a test drive.

    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

    # one way to loop
    numbers.each { |item| puts item }

    # another way to loop
    numbers.each do |item|
        puts item
    end

In the example above, we create an array called numbers.
Then we show two different ways to print each item in numbers to the console.
