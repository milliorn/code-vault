# The '.reverse' Method

The .reverse method is called the same way .length is, but instead of asking Ruby to tell you how long a string is, it spits out a backwards version of the string you gave it. For instance,

    "Eric".reverse

will result in

    "cirE"

Reversing input can be useful if you want to sort a list of values from highest to lowest instead of lowest to highest. (Weâ€™ll get to sorting in later lessons.)
