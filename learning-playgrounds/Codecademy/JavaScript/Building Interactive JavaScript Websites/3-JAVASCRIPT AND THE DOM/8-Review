JAVASCRIPT AND THE DOM

Review

In this lesson, you manipulated a webpage structure by leveraging the Document Object Model interface in JavaScript.

Letâ€™s review what we learned:

The document keyword grants access to the root of the DOM in JavaScript

The DOM Interface allows you to select a specific element with CSS selectors by using the .querySelector() method

You can also access an element directly by its ID with .getElementById()

The .innerHTML and .style properties allow you to modify an element by changing its contents or style respectively

You can create, append, and remove elements by using the .createElement(),.appendChild() and .removeChild() methods respectively

The .onclick property can add interactivity to a DOM element based on a click event
