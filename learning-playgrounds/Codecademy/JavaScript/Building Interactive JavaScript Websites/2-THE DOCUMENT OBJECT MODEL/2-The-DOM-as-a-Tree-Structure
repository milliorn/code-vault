THE DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL

The DOM as a Tree Structure

Tree-like modeling is used in many fields, including evolutionary science and data analytics. Perhaps youâ€™re already familiar with the concept of family trees: these charts represent the familial relationships amongst the descendants of a given family name.

The DOM tree follows similar logic to that of a family tree. A family tree is made up of family members and their relationships to the family name. In computer science, we would call each family member a node.

We define a node as an intersecting point in a tree that contains data.

In the DOM tree, the top-most node is called the root node, and it represents the HTML document. The descendants of the root node are the HTML tags in the document, starting with the <html> tag followed by the <head> and <body> tags and so on.
