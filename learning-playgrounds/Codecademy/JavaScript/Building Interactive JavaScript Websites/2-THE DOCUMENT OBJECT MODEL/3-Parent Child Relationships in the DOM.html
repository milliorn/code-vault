Parent Child Relationships in the DOM

Following the metaphor of a family tree, letâ€™s define some key terminology in the DOM hierarchy:

A parent node is the closet connected node to another node in the direction towards the root.

A child node is the closest connected node to another node in the direction away from the root.

Knowing these terms will allow you to understand and discuss the DOM as a tree-like structure. In fact, you will also see this terminology used when referring to the nesting structure of HTML code. Programmers refer to elements nested inside other elements as the children elements and parent elements respectively.
