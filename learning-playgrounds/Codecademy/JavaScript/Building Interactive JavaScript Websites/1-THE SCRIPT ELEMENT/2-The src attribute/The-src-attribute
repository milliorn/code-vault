THE SCRIPT ELEMENT

The src attribute

Since you know how to use a <script> element with embedded code, let’s talk about linking code. Linking code is preferable because of a programming concept called Separation of Concerns (SoC). Instead of having messy code that is all in the same file, web developers separate their code into different files, making each “concern” easier to understand and more convenient when changes must be made.

For this exercise, instead of writing JavaScript in our HTML file, we are going to write it in its own file, and then reference this code with a file path name. We will do this using an attribute that may jog your memory: the src attribute!

If this seems familiar, that’s because you may have been linking to external files with the <img> and <link> elements. The attribute is exactly the same, but now its value specifies the location of your script file.

If the file is in the same project folder, the src value will be a relative path name. Below is an example of a relative pathname to a JavaScript file.

<script src=/exampleScript.js> </script>

If you must refer to JavaScript hosted externally, or in a CDN, you can also link to that file location.
