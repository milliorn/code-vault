THE SCRIPT ELEMENT

The <script> tag

The <script> element allows you to add JavaScript code inside an HTML file. Below, the <script> element embeds valid JavaScript code:

<h1>This is an embedded JS example</h1>
<script>
  function Hello() {
    alert ('Hello World');
  }
</script>

Frankly, without the <script> tag, websites would be unclickable and a bit boring.

The <script> element, like most elements in HTML, has an opening and closing angle bracket. The closing tag marks the end of the content inside of the <script> element. Just like the <style> tag used to embed CSS code, you use the <script> tag to embed valid JavaScript code.
