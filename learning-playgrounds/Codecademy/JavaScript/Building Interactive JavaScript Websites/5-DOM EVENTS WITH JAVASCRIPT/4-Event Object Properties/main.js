/*
DOM EVENTS WITH JAVASCRIPT

Event Object Properties

JavaScript stores events as event objects with their related data and functionality as properties and methods. There are pre-determined properties associated with event objects. You can call these properties to see information about the event, for example:

the .target property to access the element that triggered the event.

the .type property to access the name of the event.

the .timeStamp property to access the number of milliseconds that passed since the document loaded and the event was triggered.

let social = document.getElementById('social-media');
let share = document.getElementById('share-button');
let text = document.getElementById('text');

// Write your code below
let sharePhoto = function(event) {
  event.target.style.display = 'none';
  text.innerHTML = `You share the puppy in ${event.timeStamp} ms.`;
}

share.onclick = sharePhoto;
