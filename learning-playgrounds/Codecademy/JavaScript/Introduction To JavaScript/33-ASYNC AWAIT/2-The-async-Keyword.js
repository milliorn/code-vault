/*
ASYNC AWAIT

The async Keyword

The async keyword is used to write functions that handle asynchronous actions. We wrap our asynchronous logic inside a function prepended with the async keyword. Then, we invoke that function.
*/

async function myFunc() {
  // Function body here
};

myFunc();

/*
We’ll be using async function declarations throughout this lesson, but we can also create async function expressions:
*/

const myFunc = async () => {
  // Function body here
};

myFunc();

/*
async functions always return a promise. This means we can use traditional promise syntax, like .then() and .catch with our async functions. An async function will return in one of three ways:

If there’s nothing returned from the function, it will return a promise with a resolved value of undefined.

If there’s a non-promise value returned from the function, it will return a promise resolved to that value.

If a promise is returned from the function, it will simply return that promise
*/

async function fivePromise() { 
  return 5;
}

fivePromise()
.then(resolvedValue => {
    console.log(resolvedValue);
  })  // Prints 5

/*
In the example above, even though we return 5 inside the function body, what’s actually returned when we invoke fivePromise() is a promise with a resolved value of 5.

Let’s write an async function!

function withConstructor(num){
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    if (num === 0){
      resolve('zero');
    } else {
      resolve('not zero');
    }
  })
}

withConstructor(0)
  .then((resolveValue) => {
  console.log(` withConstructor(0) returned a promise which resolved to: ${resolveValue}.`);
})

// Write your code below:
async function withAsync(num) {
	if (num === 0){
  	return 'zero';
  } else {
  	return 'not zero';
  }

// Leave this commented out until step 3:
withAsync(100)
  .then((resolveValue) => {
  console.log(` withAsync(100) returned a promise which resolved to: ${resolveValue}.`);
