/*
ASYNC AWAIT

Introduction

Often in web development, we need to handle asynchronous actions— actions we can wait on while moving on to other tasks. We make requests to networks, databases, or any number of similar operations. JavaScript is non-blocking: instead of stopping the execution of code while it waits, JavaScript uses an event-loop which allows it to efficiently execute other tasks while it awaits the completion of these asynchronous actions.

Originally, JavaScript used callback functions to handle asynchronous actions. The problem with callbacks is that they encourage complexly nested code which quickly becomes difficult to read, debug, and scale. With ES6, JavaScript integrated native promises which allow us to write significantly more readable code. JavaScript is continually improving, and ES8 provides a new syntax for handling our asynchronous action, async...await. The async...await syntax allows us to write asynchronous code that reads similarly to traditional synchronous, imperative programs.

The async...await syntax is syntactic sugar— it doesn’t introduce new functionality into the language, but rather introduces a new syntax for using promises and generators. Both of these were already built in to the language. Despite this, async...await powerfully improves the readability and scalability of our code. Let’s learn how to use it!

const fs = require('fs');
const promisifiedReadfile = require('./promisifiedReadfile');
      
// Here we use fs.readfile() and callback functions:
fs.readFile('./file.txt', 'utf-8', (err, data) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  let firstSentence = data;
  fs.readFile('./file2.txt',  'utf-8', (err, data) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    let secondSentence = data;
    console.log(firstSentence, secondSentence)
  });
});

// Here we use native promises with our "promisified" version of readfile:
let firstSentence
promisifiedReadfile('./file.txt', 'utf-8')
  .then((data) => {
    firstSentence = data;
    return promisifiedReadfile('./file2.txt', 'utf-8')
  })
  .then((data) => {
    let secondSentence = data;
    console.log(firstSentence, secondSentence)
  })
  .catch((err) => {console.log(err)});

// Here we use promisifiedReadfile() again but instead of using the native promise .then() syntax, we declare and invoke an async/await function:
async function readFiles() {
  let firstSentence = await promisifiedReadfile('./file.txt', 'utf-8')
  let secondSentence = await promisifiedReadfile('./file2.txt', 'utf-8')
  console.log(firstSentence, secondSentence)
}
readFiles()
