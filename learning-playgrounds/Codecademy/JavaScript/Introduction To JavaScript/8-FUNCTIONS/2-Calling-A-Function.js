Calling a Function

As we saw in previous exercises, a function declaration binds a function to an identifier.

However, a function declaration does not ask the code inside the function body to run, it just declares the existence of the function. The code inside a function body runs, or executes, only when the function is called. To call a function in your code, you type the function name followed by parentheses.

function sayThanks() {
  console.log('Thank you for your purchase! We appreciate your business.');
}

sayThanks();
sayThanks();
sayThanks();
