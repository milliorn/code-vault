/*
OBJECTS

Looping Through Objects

Loops are programming tools that repeat a block of code until a condition is met. We learned how to iterate through arrays using their numerical indexing, but the key-value pairs in objects aren’t ordered! JavaScript has given us alternative solution for iterating through objects with the for...in syntax .

for...in will execute a given block of code for each property in an object.
