BROWSER COMPATIBILITY AND TRANSPILATION

Introduction

You’re probably prompted to update your web browser every few months. Do you know why? A few reasons include addressing security vulnerabilities, adding features, and supporting new HTML, CSS, and JavaScript syntax.

The reasons above imply there is a period before a software update is released when there are security vulnerabilities and unsupported language syntax.

This lesson focuses on the latter. Specifically, how developers address the gap between the new JavaScript syntax that they use and the JavaScript syntax that web browsers recognize.

This has become a widespread concern for web developers since Ecma International, the organization responsible for standardizing JavaScript, released a new version of it in 2015, called ECMAScript2015, commonly referred to as ES6. Note, the 6 refers to the version of JavaScript and is not related to the year it was released (the previous version was ES5).

Upon release, web developers quickly adopted the new ES6 syntax, as it improved readability and efficiency. However, ES6 was not supported by most web browsers, so developers ran into browser compatibility issues.

In this lesson, you will learn about two important tools for addressing browser compatibility issues.

caniuse.com — A website that provides data on web browser compatibility for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript features. You will learn how to use it to look up ES6 feature support.
Babel — A Javascript library that you can use to convert new, unsupported JavaScript (ES6), into an older version (ES5) that is recognized by most modern browsers.

var pasta = "Spaghetti"; // ES5 syntax

const meat = "Pancetta"; // ES6 syntax

let sauce = "Eggs and cheese"; // ES6 syntax

// Template literals, like the one below, were introduced in ES6
const carbonara = `You can make carbonara with ${pasta}, ${meat}, and a sauce made with ${sauce}.`;
