/*
REQUESTS II

fetch() GET Requests I

The first type of requests we’re going to tackle are GET requests using fetch()

MDN: Fetch API.

The fetch() function:

Creates a request object that contains relevant information that an API needs.

Sends that request object to the API endpoint provided.

Returns a promise that ultimately resolves to a response object, which contains 

the status of the promise with information the API sent back.
