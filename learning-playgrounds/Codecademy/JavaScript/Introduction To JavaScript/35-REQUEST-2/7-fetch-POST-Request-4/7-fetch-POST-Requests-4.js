/*
REQUESTS II

fetch() POST Requests IV

In the previous exercise you’ve positioned yourself to make the POST request by providing the endpoint and the object containing all the necessary information. In this exercise you’ll handle the response.

The request returns a Promise which will either be resolved or rejected. If the promise resolves, you can use that information and the ok status. Let’s implement that knowledge into your code!
