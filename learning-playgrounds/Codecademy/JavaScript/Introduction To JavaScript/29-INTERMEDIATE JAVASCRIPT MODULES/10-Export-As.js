INTERMEDIATE JAVASCRIPT MODULES

Export as

Named exports also conveniently offer a way to change the name of variables when we export or import them. We can do this with the as keyword.

Letâ€™s see how this works. In our menu.js example
*/

let specialty = '';
let isVegetarian = function() {}; 
let isLowSodium = function() {}; 

export { specialty as chefsSpecial, isVegetarian as isVeg, isLowSodium };

/*
In the above example, take a look at the export statement at the bottom of the of the file.

The as keyword allows us to give a variable name an alias as demonstrated in specialty as chefsSpecial and isVegetarian as isVeg.

Since we did not give isLowSodium an alias, it will maintain its original name.
