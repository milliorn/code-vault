# Rooster Regulation

An experimental rooster object has been developed without any tests! It’s up to you to write them.

By the end of this project you will have a fast, complete, reliable, isolated, maintainable, and expressive test suite: it will provide confidence that the rooster is functioning correctly and it will act as a form of documentation for other developers.

You can find the rooster defined in index.js. You will write a test suite in index_test.js within the test directory using the Mocha test framework and assert methods from the Node.js standard library. If you’re unsure about any of the methods, you can use the documentation linked.

Using require(), import the assert module at the top of index_test.js.

Using require(), import the Rooster module from ../index. This allows you to access methods for testing.

Write a describe block for Rooster.

Within the first block write another describe block for the .announceDawn method.

Within the nested describe block, write an it block that tests that the method 'returns a rooster call'.

Within the it block, write the relevant test using an assert function.

Save your changes and run the test in the command line. You’ve discovered an issue in index.js! Make the correction.
