## Overview

This project is slightly different than others you have encountered thus far on Codecademy. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project you’ll be building. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.

## Project Goals

In this project, you’ll be building a small Express.js web API to store and serve different quotes about computers, coding, and technology.

## Setup Instructions

If you choose to do this project on your computer instead of Codecademy, you can download what you’ll need by clicking the “Download” button below. You’ll need to open and work in server.js in a text editor. To edit server.js, use your text editor of choice. If you need a recommendation or help to install an editor, we recommend looking into our article about setting up a text editor for web development (Follow along until you get to the section: “Practice: Let’s Make a Project”). To run your API on your computer, you will need to install Node.js. If you need help installing Node.js, read our article on installing Node.

Once you have an editor an Node.js set up, download the project, unzip it, navigate to that folder in your terminal and run npm install to install Express before trying to start up your server.
