# Welcome to the Back-End Engineering Path

Welcome to the Back-End Engineer Career Path! In this path, you will encounter all of the major technologies that a back-end developer should know. You will gain a foundation in JavaScript programming, understand different programming design principles, and build secure back-ends with Node/Express and PostgreSQL. We’ll also make sure to prepare you for the infamous technical interviews you’ll encounter once you begin your job hunt.

## Learning Objectives

After this Path, you will be able to:

Set up your own dev environment and version control your work with Git/GitHub
Have a working understanding of front-end technologies
Write client-side and server-side JavaScript code
Build Node/Express back-ends
Design and build PostgreSQL databases
Understand design and development principles, like OOP, KISS, YAGNI, and DRY
Implement best security practices to prevent attacks
Learned about enterprise software development strategies
Pass a JavaScript whiteboard interview

## Projects

You will demonstrate your knowledge in several Portfolio Projects that exist throughout the Path. Portfolio Projects are projects that you build on your own computer, following a set of requirements. Each one will be unique to your personal vision and set of interests. You can complete the Portfolio Projects either in parallel with or after taking the prerequisite content—it’s up to you!

Here’s a preview of the projects featured in this Path:

Mixed Messages

Build a Node.js console app that generates random messages each time a user runs the program and version your project with Git/GitHub
Personal Budgeting, Part I

Use Node.js and Express to build an API for an app that mimics the practice of envelope budgeting
Personal Budgeting, Part II

Add a PostgreSQL database layer to your budget app and implement software architecture principles like KISS and YAGNI
Photo Caption Contest:

Build an API with Node, Express, and Postgres that uses authentication and authorization best practices to manage an online contest
Final Back-End Project

Use everything you’ve learned in the path to build an API of your choosing

## Curated Content

Throughout this path you may see some items that aren’t made by the Codecademy team. We’ve included these to ensure that you learn all the topics you need to get your career started. Though we didn’t write them, we’ve vetted them ourselves for technical accuracy and good teaching practices. When possible, we’ve written relevant assessments so that you can check your understanding back on our platform.

We’re excited for you to begin this journey!
