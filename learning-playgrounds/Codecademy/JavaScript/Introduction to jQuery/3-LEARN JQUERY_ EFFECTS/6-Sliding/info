LEARN JQUERY: EFFECTS

Sliding

Have you ever been to a website and seen HTML elements slide into place? Many websites use this effect to show menus; you click on your profile image and a menu slides down revealing different settings and options that you can change. These sites are likely using jQuery sliding effects.

By using sliding effects, an element on your web page will slide up or down into place instead of appearing or disappearing. Just like with the other effects, sliding can be applied to any element on your page whether it be an image, a video, or text.

Sliding methods are animations; they happen over a period of time. As a result, sliding methods have an optional parameter to determine how long the animation will take.


$('.menu-button').on('click', () => {
  $('.menu-content').slideDown('slow');
});


In the above code, we call the .slideDown() method on the elements of class menu-content whenever menu-button elements are clicked. The slow parameter determines the speed of the animation.
