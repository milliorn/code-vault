.toggle()

Great work! Our table now has two buttons that hide and show our image. But wouldnâ€™t it be nice to have one button do both? It is common for web pages to have one button that will either hide or show elements depending on their current state. We can achieve this by using the .toggle() method.


$('.toggle-button').on('click', () => {
  $('.shoe-information-3').toggle();
});


In the above code we call the .toggle() method on elements of class shoe-information-3. If the information is visible, clicking the .toggle-button will hide it, as if the following code were run.


$('.toggle-button').on('click', () => {
  $('.shoe-information-3').hide();
});


At the same time, if the shoe information is hidden, it will show itself as if the following code were run:


$('.toggle-button').on('click', () => {
  $('.shoe-information-3').show();
});
