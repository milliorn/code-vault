JQUERY SETUP

Targeting by id

While classes allow us to target multiple elements at once, we can also target single elements by id.

To select by id, we prepend the element’s id name with the # symbol.


$('#someId').hide();


In the example above, we target the #someId element and call the .hide() method on it. The .hide() method hides the someId element when the web page renders to a client’s browser.

Let’s target by id to hide the navigation menu in our MOVE Gear site.
