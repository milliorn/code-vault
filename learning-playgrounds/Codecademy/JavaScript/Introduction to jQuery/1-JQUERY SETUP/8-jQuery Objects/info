JQUERY SETUP

jQuery Objects

Now that you’ve seen some jQuery in action, let’s dive a bit deeper into syntax. You’ve probably noticed the $ symbol before anything we target. The $ symbol is an alias for the jQuery function. The $ symbol and jQuery are interchangeable.

The jQuery function takes a parameter that targets an element, like '#navMenu', and turns it into a jQuery object. Then, you can call any jQuery method on a jQuery object.

Developers often save jQuery objects in variables, like so:


const $jQueryObject = $('.someClass');


Notice our variable name, $jQueryObject, starts with the ($) character. It is best practice to name jQuery object variables with a leading $. It is a naming convention that reminds you and lets others know that a given variable is a jQuery object.

With this in mind, let’s improve our code from the previous Exercise.
