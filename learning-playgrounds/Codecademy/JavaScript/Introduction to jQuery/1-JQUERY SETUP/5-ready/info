JQUERY SETUP

.ready()

The jQuery library makes it quick and easy to add visual effects and interactivity to your web page. However, a web page must be rendered in a user’s browser before it’s possible to have any dynamic behavior. To solve this problem, we will use our first jQuery method.

The jQuery .ready() method waits until the HTML page’s DOM is ready to manipulate. You should wrap all JavaScript behavior inside of the .ready() method. This will make sure the web page is rendered in the browser before any jQuery code executes.


$(document).ready(() => {

});


In the example above, the .ready() method waits until the browser finishes rendering the HTML document before triggering a callback function. We will write all of our jQuery behavior inside this callback function.
