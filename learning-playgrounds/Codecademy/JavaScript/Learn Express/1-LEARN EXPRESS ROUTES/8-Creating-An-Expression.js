Creating An Expression

POST is the HTTP method verb used for creating new resources. Because POST routes create new data, their paths do not end with a route parameter, but instead end with the type of resource to be created.

For example, to create a new monster, a client would make a POST request to /monsters. The client does not know the id of the monster until it is created and sent back by the server, therefore POST /monsters/:id doesn’t make sense because a client couldn’t know the unique id of a monster before it exists.

Express uses .post() as its method for POST requests. POST requests can use many ways of sending data to create new resources, including query strings.

The HTTP status code for a newly-created resource is 201 Created.
