Congratulations on completing this lesson! In this lesson, we covered a number of different techniques for dynamically styling Vue elements.

We learned how to dynamically add inline styles using v-bind:style with a style object or an array of style objects. We then learned how to dynamically add classes using v-bind:class with a class object or an array of class objects and class name strings.

It may seem like any one of these techniques would be sufficient for dynamically styling a front-end app — and that’s true! As you continue learning about Vue, you will see advantages and use cases for each technique.

The important thing to take away at this stage in your learning journey is that you should aim to use the technique that keeps your code the most readable and leaves your app with the least repetitive code.
