# Input Modifiers

Modifiers are incredibly useful tools for quickly adding essential front-end logic to directives. Vue offers modifiers for many of their directives, including the main topic of this lesson: v-model. Yes, that’s right, we can use modifiers to make our form fields even more versatile.

Vue offers the following three modifiers for v-model:

.number — automatically converts the value in the form field to a number
.trim — removes whitespace from the beginning and ends of the form field value
.lazy — only updates data values when change events are triggered (often when a user moves away from the form field rather than after every keystroke)

You can find out more information about these modifiers in the Vue documentation.
