# Getting Started with Vue

Welcome to Vue Data! In Introduction to Vue, we briefly covered some of the most exciting features of Vue. In this lesson, we will start by reviewing how to create Vue apps and display dynamic data. We will then explore the different types of data that Vue can store and display in far more depth.

    The first step to beginning any Vue project is to import the Vue library. For simple projects, we do this by adding the following <script> tag to the <head> of the HTML file that will contain the Vue app:

    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue/dist/vue.js" defer></script>
