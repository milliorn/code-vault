# Learn Vue.js

## Why learn Vue.js?

Modern web apps require increasingly complicated front-ends that can handle large amounts of user interactions and dynamic data. For example, Instagram has over 95 million new posts added per day. Front-end frameworks are JavaScript libraries that make it easy to write the code to create and display this enormous amount of data.

There are many popular front-end frameworks used by engineers today, including React and Angular. Vue.js is an up-and-coming front-end framework that aims to combine the best aspects of all of these frameworks in one easy-to-use package. In fact, in the 2018 State of JavaScript survey, Vue.js was the most sought after front-end framework by a landslide, with 46.6% of all front-end developers saying that they want to learn it.

In short, Vue.js makes front-end web development easier and more exciting than it’s ever been. Jump in and find out what this front-end engineering trend is all about!
