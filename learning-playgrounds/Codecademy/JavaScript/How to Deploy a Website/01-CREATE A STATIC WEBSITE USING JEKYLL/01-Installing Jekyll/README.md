# Installing Jekyll

Before we can generate a website, we must install Jekyll.

Jekyll is a Ruby gem (also known as a RubyGem) and can be installed from the command line. Donâ€™t worry, knowledge of Ruby is not required in order to complete this course.

Once Jekyll is installed, we can use it to generate your website.

Install Jekyll by typing the following command in the terminal:

    gem install jekyll

Wait for the gem to finish installing before moving onto the next exercise. A successful install will display the following:

    Successfully installed jekyll-3.1.3
    Parsing documentation for jekyll-3.1.3
    Installing ri documentation for jekyll-3.1.3
    Done installing documentation for jekyll
