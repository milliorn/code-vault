# How to Deploy a Website

## Why Learn to Deploy a Website?

Deploying—or pushing new code to a server—is an integral part of a developer’s daily workflow. Knowing the relationship between your computer (including your local development environment) and the Internet, as well as how to communicate between the two, is essential for every developer.

## Take-Away Skills

In Deploy a Website, you’ll learn how to take website content and publish it to the Internet. You’ll learn how to use Jekyll, a handy tool used frequently by developers to get new static sites quickly up and running.

You’ll also use the GitHub workflow to host your site using the GitHub Pages service. Finally, you’ll use Amazon Web Services (AWS), an industry-standard tool for developers, to purchase a custom domain name and assign it to your personal website.
