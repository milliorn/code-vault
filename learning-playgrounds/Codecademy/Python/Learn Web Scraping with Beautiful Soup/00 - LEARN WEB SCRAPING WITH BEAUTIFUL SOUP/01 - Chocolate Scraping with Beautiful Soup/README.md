# Chocolate Scraping with Beautiful Soup

After eating chocolate bars your whole life, you’ve decided to go on a quest to find the greatest chocolate bar in the world.

You’ve found a website that has over 1700 reviews of chocolate bars from all around the world. It’s displayed in the web browser on this page.

The data is displayed in a table, instead of in a csv or json. Thankfully, we have the power of BeautifulSoup that will help us transform this webpage into a DataFrame that we can manipulate and analyze.

The rating scale is from 1-5, as described in this review guide. A 1 is “unpleasant” chocolate, while a 5 is a bar that transcends “beyond the ordinary limits”.

Some questions we thought about when we found this dataset were: Where are the best cocoa beans grown? Which countries produce the highest-rated bars? What’s the relationship between cocoa solids percentage and rating?

Can we find a way to answer these questions, or uncover more questions, using BeautifulSoup and Pandas?
