# Mystery Friend

You’ve received an anonymous postcard from a friend who you haven’t seen in years. Your friend did not leave a name, but the card is definitely addressed to you. So far, you’ve narrowed your search down to three friends, based on handwriting:

    Emma Goldman
    Matthew Henson
    TingFang Wu

But which one sent you the card?

Just like you can classify a message as spam or not spam with a spam filter, you can classify writing as related to one friend or another by building a kind of friend writing classifier. You have past writing from all three friends stored up in the variable friends_docs, which means you can use scikit-learn’s bag-of-words and Naive Bayes classifier to determine who the mystery friend is!
