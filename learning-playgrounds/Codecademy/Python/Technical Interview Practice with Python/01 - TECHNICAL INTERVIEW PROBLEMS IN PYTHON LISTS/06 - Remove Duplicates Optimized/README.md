# Remove Duplicates: Optimized

Remove Duplicates: Optimized
For the last problem our suggested solutions had O(N) time and/or O(N) space complexity.

We can’t improve the time complexity. We have to visit each value to determine whether or not it is a duplicate.

We can reduce the space complexity to O(1) with an in-place solution.

We’ll adjust the problem to allow for this space complexity. Now we want to alter a sorted input list with all duplicates moved to the end of the list.

The return value will be the index of the final unique value.

    duplicates = ['a', 'a', 'g', 't', 't', 'x', 'x', 'x']
    remove_dups(duplicates)
    # 3, index of the last unique value: 'x'
    duplicates
    # ['a', 'g', 't', 'x' 'a', 'x', 't', 'x']

Clarifying Questions:

Does the ordering of the duplicate(s) matter?
No! They can be in any order.
