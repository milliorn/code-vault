# Max list sub-sum: Naive

Our next problem calculates sums within a list.

Given a list of integers, return the maximum sum possible from a contiguous sub-list. A sub-list is an uninterrupted portion of the list (up to and including the entire list).

    nums = [1, -7, 2, 15, -11, 2]

    maximum_sub_sum(nums)
    # 17
    # The sum of sub-list nums[2:4]

Clarifying Questions:

    Are there constraints on time or space efficiency?
    No! Any solution will do.
    Are all the numbers positive?
    No! Negative numbers can be in the input.
    How big or small can the sub-list be?
    From a single element to the entire list.
