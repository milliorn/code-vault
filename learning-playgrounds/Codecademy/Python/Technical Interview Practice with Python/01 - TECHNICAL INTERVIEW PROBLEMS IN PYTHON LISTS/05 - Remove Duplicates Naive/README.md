# Remove Duplicates: Naive

Duplicate values? Who needs them!

Given a list of values with duplicates, return a list holding the same values in the same order with all duplicates removed.

    duplicates = ['a', 'a', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'g', 't', 't']
    remove_dups(duplicates)
    # ['a', 'x', 'g', 't']

    more_duplicates = [3, 3, 1, 7, 7, 7]
    remove_dups(more_duplicates)
    # [3, 1, 7]

This is a great problem because there are many different ways to solve it. Questions with multiple solutions are an opportunity to discuss with the interviewer.

Remember: the ability to communicate is essential!

Clarifying Questions:

Are there constraints on time or space efficiency?
No! Any solution will do.
Is it okay to alter the input list?
You can alter the list or return a new list.
