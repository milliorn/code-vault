# Rotation Point: Linear Search

We’ll continue our theme of list rotation by flipping the problem: given a sorted list rotated k times, return the index where the “unrotated” list would begin.

    rotated_list = ['c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'a']
    rotation_point(rotated_list)
    # index 4
    # a sorted list would start with 'a'

    another_rotated_list = [13, 8, 9, 10, 11] 
    rotation_point(rotated_list)
    # index 1
    # a sorted list would start with 8

Clarifying Questions:

    Are there constraints on time or space efficiency?
    No! Any solution will do.
    Does the rotation direction matter?
    This won’t affect the return value.
    What if the input isn’t rotated?
    Return 0.
