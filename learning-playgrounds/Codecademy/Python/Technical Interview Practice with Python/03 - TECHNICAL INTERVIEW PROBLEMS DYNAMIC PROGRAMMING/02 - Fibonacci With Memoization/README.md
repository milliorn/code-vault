# Fibonacci With Memoization

The Fibonacci sequence is a perfect case to apply dynamic programming. Each Fibonacci number relies on two previous numbers, and those numbers never change. We have overlapping sub-problems!

We’ll store the answers to sub-problems using memoization. Think of it like jotting notes down on a memo.

With each sub-problem, we’ll check if we have a note in our memo. If we do, then we can use that information, otherwise, we’ll need to do a calculation and then store that calculation in our memo pad!

Remember these notes are possible because the answer will always be the same:
the nth Fibonacci number will never change. Just like the 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 example,
we don’t need to recompute the 3rd and 4th Fibonacci number to calculate the 5th
Fibonacci number if we already know the 3rd and 4th number.
