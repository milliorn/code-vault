# RGB-HEX Converter

In this project, we’ll use Bitwise operators to build a calculator that can convert RGB values to Hexadecimal (hex) values, and vice-versa.

We’ll add three methods to the project:

A method to convert RGB to Hex
A method to convert Hex to RGB
A method that starts the prompt cycle
The program should do the following:

Prompt the user for the type of conversion they want
Ask the user to input the RGB or Hex value
Use Bitwise operators and shifting in order to convert the value
Print the converted value to the user
It’s useful to know some background on RGB and hex values, so we recommend reading the resources we linked to.

Note: As with professional software development, you should be saving your code very often. As you code, make sure you click the “Save” button below to save your code/changes. Otherwise, you run the risk of losing all your code.

Let’s begin!
