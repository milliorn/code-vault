# Bank Account

In this project, we’ll create a Python class that can be used to create and manipulate a personal bank account.

The bank account class you’ll create should have methods for each of the following:

Accepting deposits
Allowing withdrawals
Showing the balance
Showing the details of the account
Note: As with professional software development, you should be saving your code very often. As you code, make sure you click the “Save” button below to save your code/changes. Otherwise, you run the risk of losing all your code!

Let’s begin!
