# Rock, Paper, Scissors

In this project, we’ll build Rock-Paper-Scissors!

The program should do the following:

Prompt the user to select either Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
Instruct the computer to randomly select either Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
Compare the user’s choice and the computer’s choice.
Determine a winner (the user or the computer).
Inform the user who the winner is.
Happy coding!
