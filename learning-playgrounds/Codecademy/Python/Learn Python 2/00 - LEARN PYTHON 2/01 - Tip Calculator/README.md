# Tip Calculator

Now that you have completed the lesson on Python syntax, it’s time to practice your newfound skills. In this project, you will create a simple calculator that determines the price of a meal after tax and tip.

Tasks

Declare your variables
1.
You just finished eating at a restaurant, and received this bill:

Cost of meal: $44.50

Restaurant tax: 6.75%

Tip: 15%

You’ll apply the tip to the overall cost of the meal (including tax). First, declare a variable called meal and assign it the value 44.50.
2.
Let’s create a variable for the tax percentage.

The tax on your receipt is 6.75%. You’ll have to divide 6.75 by 100 in order to get the decimal form of the percentage.

Create the variable tax and set it equal to the decimal value of 6.75%.
3.
You received good service, so you’d like to leave a 15% tip on top of the cost of the meal, including tax.

Before we compute the tip amount for your bill, let’s set a variable for the tip percentage. We need to get the decimal form of the tip, so we divide 15.0 by 100.

Store this value in a variable called tip.

Do some calculations
4.
We have the three variables we need to perform our calculation, and we know some arithmetic operators that can help us out.

We saw in Lesson 1 that we can reassign variables. We could say:

cash_in_wallet = 7
then later change our minds and say:

cash_in_wallet = 0
Reassign meal to the value of itself + itself * tax.

We’re only calculating the cost of meal and tax here. We will add tip in the next step.
5.
Now that meal has the cost of the food plus tax, create a variable total that is equal to meal + meal * tip.
6.
Print out the value of total.

Congratulations! You have calculated the value of your bill!
