# When Fibs Are Good

Nice work! Weâ€™ll demonstrate another classic recursive function: fibonacci().

fibonacci() should return the Nth Fibonacci number, where N is the number given as input. The first two numbers of a Fibonacci Sequence start with 0 and 1. Every subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.

Our recursive implementation:

runtime: Exponential - O(2^N)

def fibonacci(n):
  if n < 0:
    ValueError("Input 0 or greater only!")
  if n <= 1:
    return n
  return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
