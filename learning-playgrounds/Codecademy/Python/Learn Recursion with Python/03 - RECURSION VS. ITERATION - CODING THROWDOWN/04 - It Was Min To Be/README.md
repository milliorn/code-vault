# It Was Min To Be

Weâ€™ll use an iterative solution to the following problem: find the minimum value in a list.

def find_min(my_list):
    min = None
    for element in my_list:
        if not min or (element < min):
            min = element
    return min

find_min([42, 17, 2, -1, 67])

-1

find_mind([])

None

find_min([13, 72, 19, 5, 86])

5

This solution has a linear runtime, or O(N), where N is the number of elements in the list.
