# Why Blockchain

In 2010, a programmer paid 10,000 Bitcoins for 2 pizzas, roughly worth $30. In 2018, that same number of bitcoins is estimated at $83 million in value!

The exchange of Bitcoin is possible due to an underlying technology that secures and simplifies transactions removing the need for a bank or a central authority. Anyone with an internet connection has the freedom to own and exchange this digital currency. The powerful architecture that drove this revolution was blockchain. Businesses started to realize the potential of blockchain and are rapidly mobilizing to understand and implement it. But, what exactly is blockchain and what makes it so transformative?
