# Creating Blocks

Now let’s think of a way to represent a block in Python. We could create a bigger dictionary and store our data inside this dictionary. But since blocks can be represented as objects, let’s create a Block Class which we can easily use to create new blocks.

Recall that a Block contains the following properties:

Timestamp\
Transaction\
Hash\
Previous Hash\
Nonce

In this exercise, we will be creating the default constructor for the Block class in our Mini-Blockchain.
