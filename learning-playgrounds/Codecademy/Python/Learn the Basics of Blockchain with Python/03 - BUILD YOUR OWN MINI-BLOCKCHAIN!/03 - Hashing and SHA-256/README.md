# Hashing and SHA-256

Before we create a more dynamic blockchain, letâ€™s learn how to use a hash function in Python. Specifically, we will be using the SHA-256 hash function which can be easily imported in Python.

We will use the SHA-256 as a regular function that takes in a random string as its argument. To properly use this function in Python 3, our string must be encoded before being passed as an argument. To encode the string, we use the .encode() method.
