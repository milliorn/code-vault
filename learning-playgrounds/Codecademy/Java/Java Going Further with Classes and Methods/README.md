# Java: Going Further with Classes and Methods

In this course, we’re going to take a deep dive into Java classes. We’ll start by looking at the String class in more detail. After spending more time with Strings, we’ll dive into some of the more advanced features of Classes. Specifically, we’ll look at how to set the access of class variables and methods, discuss the concept of encapsulation, and write our own static methods.
