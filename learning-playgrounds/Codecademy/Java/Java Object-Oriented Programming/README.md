# Java: Object-Oriented Programming

Object-oriented programming is a common style of programming where you design your code to function like objects in the real world. In Java, understanding the basics of object-oriented programming is especially important because every piece of Java code that you write interacts with objects and classes.

In this course, youâ€™ll learn the foundations of object-oriented programming, write your own classes, create your own objects, and finally dive into some of the most common built-in Java classes.
