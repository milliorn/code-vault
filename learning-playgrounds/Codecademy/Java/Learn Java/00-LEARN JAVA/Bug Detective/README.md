# Bug Detective

Your friend built a program to mimic a fortune cookie by randomly printing a random fortune on each run. A fortune cookie is a crisp cookie with a piece of paper inside, on which is a “fortune.”

However, your friend didn’t use incremental development and debug along the way, so she ended up with a super buggy program. Can you be a bug detective and help her debug her program Fortune.java?

The output should look something like:

    Flattery will go far tonight.

Or:

    Don't behave with cold manners.

Final tip: If the compiler reports 100 error messages, that doesn’t mean there are 100 errors in the program. Sometimes when a compiler encounters an error, it often gets thrown off track. Only the first error message is truly reliable. Always scroll to the top and try to debug the very first error first.
