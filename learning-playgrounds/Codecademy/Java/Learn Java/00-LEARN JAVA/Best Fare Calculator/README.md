# Best Fare Calculator

## Overview

This project is slightly different than others you have encountered thus far on Codecademy. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project you’ll be building. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.

## Project Goals

If you’ve ever wondered if you chose the right fare option for riding the metro or bus, you’re not alone. In this project you will write a Java program that determines the best fare option for someone visiting New York City who plans to use the NYC transit system. The program should use constructors, methods, conditionals, loops, and arrays.
