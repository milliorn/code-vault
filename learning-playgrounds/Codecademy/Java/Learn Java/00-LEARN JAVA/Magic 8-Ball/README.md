# Magic 8-Ball

## Overview

This project is slightly different than others you have encountered thus far on Codecademy. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project youâ€™ll be building. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.

## Project Goals

The Magic 8-Ball is a super popular toy used for fortune-telling or seeking advice, developed in the 1950s!

Write a Magic8.java program that will output a random fortune each time it executes.

Research on the web ways to create a random number with Java.

Your program should use a random number and an if-else if-else statement or a switch statement to output a random fortune/piece of advice.
