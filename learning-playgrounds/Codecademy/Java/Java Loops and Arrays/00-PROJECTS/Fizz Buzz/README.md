# Fizz Buzz

Fizz Buzz is a common developer interview question; so common it’s almost cliché!

The challenge is designed to weed out 99.5% programming job candidates who cannot creatively use their coding knowledge to solve coding problems.

Write a FizzBuzz.java program that outputs numbers from 1 to 100… with a catch:

For multiples of 3, print Fizz instead of the number.
For the multiples of 5, print Buzz.
For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print FizzBuzz.
