# Build A Droid

We’ve set up a robot workshop to build some droids. All that’s missing are the instructions on how to create the robots and what they’ll do.

Can we write a Java class to help?

We’ll need to define the state and behavior of the droids using instance fields and methods. Let’s get to work!
