In the previous Unquote project, Game Logic Part. I, you created the logic required for several key game components. In this project, you will expand on that work by tracking gameplay data within the MainActivity object. In the end, Unquote will make use of data such as the list of questions, the current question visible on-screen, the number of correct answers, and more!
