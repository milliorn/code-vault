# Question.java

Java is an Object-oriented languageâ€”we use Java to represent concepts by organizing them into collections of information (data) and behaviors (methods). For example, we can programmatically represent animals as having one to four legs (as data), and the ability to run (as a method).

  public class Animal {

    int numberOfLegs;

 

    void run() {
      // Get that blood pumping!
    }

  }

In the Unquote application, trivia questions are the objects we must represent with Java. In this project, you will define the Question class and its data, all of which become a part of your final Android application, Unquote.
