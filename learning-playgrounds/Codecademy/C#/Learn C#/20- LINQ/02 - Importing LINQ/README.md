# Importing LINQ

Before we jump into the syntax and methods, letâ€™s import the features into our code. To use LINQ in a file, add this line to the top:

    using System.Linq;

Often times we use LINQ with generic collections (like lists), so you may see both namespaces imported into a file:

    using System.Collections.Generic;
    using System.Linq;
