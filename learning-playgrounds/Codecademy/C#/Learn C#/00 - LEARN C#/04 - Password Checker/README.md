Password Checker

A computer can run thousands of operations per minute. If someone wanted to steal your information, they use each operation to make a guess at your password. With one high-performance computer and the right software, a 6 letter single-case password can be broken in one day.

Apart from quitting the internet entirely, what can we do to protect ourselves? We can increase our password’s strength: make it longer and more complex.

In this project you’ll make a program that measures the strength of any given password based on the following criteria. A strong password:

is at least 8 characters long
has lowercase letters
has uppercase letters
has numerical digits
has symbols, like #, ?, !
The program will ask the user to input a password, and using conditional logic and control flow, it will rate the password.
