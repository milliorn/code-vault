Choose Your Own Adventure

In this project, you’ll use logic and conditional statements to write a classic text-based Choose Your Own Adventure Game. Depending on what choices your user makes, the program will have a different result. If you’re interested in game development, this is a great project to get your started! While we’re only working with text, the principles of user input and control flow are used to build even highly advanced games.

We’ve provided you with a template to write a game, but we highly encourage you to take what you’ve learned here and use your creativity to write an original game, either here on Codecademy or off-platform!
