LEARN C#
Supernatural Inheritance
At the Codecademy Guild of the Supernatural, there are three ranks of magicians. They rank from least to most powerful: Pupils, Mages, and Archmages. In this project you’ll be developing a system in C# to track the weather magicians in the guild and their spells.

Pupils have a title and can create one weak wind storm.
Mages have a title and can create a weak wind storm and a weak rain storm.
Archmages have a title and can create a weak wind storm, a strong rain storm, and a strong lightning storm.
Notice anything shared in these ranks? If we created a class for each type of magician, we would have a lot of duplicated code. For example, every magician has a title and wind storm. To avoid duplication, we’ll use inheritance.

Pupil is the base class
Mage inherits from Pupil
Archmage inherits from Mage
Archmage inherits from Mage, which inherits from Pupil

We’ll also need a Storm class, which stores the essence, strength, and the title of the magician who created it.

Let’s get started!
