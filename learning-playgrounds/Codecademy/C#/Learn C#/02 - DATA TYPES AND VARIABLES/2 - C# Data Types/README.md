DATA TYPES AND VARIABLES

C# Data Types

Data types tell us a few things about a piece of data, like:

How it can be stored
What operations we can perform with it
Different methods it can be used with
Data types are present in all programming languages, but are particularly important in C#. That’s because C# is known as a strongly-typed language—it requires that the programmer specify the data type of every value and expression. While it means writing more code, using types has long term benefits like built-in documentation and increased readability.

As we can see to the diagram to the right, C# has several built-in data types. You don’t need to memorize all of them, but pay specific attention to these common ones that we’ll use throughout our lessons:

int - whole numbers, like: 1, -56, 948
double - decimal numbers, like: 239.43909, -660.01
char - single characters, like: “a”, “&”, “£”
string - string of characters, like: “dog”, “hello world”
bool - boolean values, like: true or false
