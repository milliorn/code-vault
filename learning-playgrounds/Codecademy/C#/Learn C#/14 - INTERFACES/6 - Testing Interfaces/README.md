INTERFACES
Testing Interfaces
Now we have a Sedan class and Truck class that implement the IAutomobile interface. Though they have some different behaviors, they both have the properties and method defined in the interface:

double Speed
string LicensePlate
int Wheels
void Honk()
At this point we can be confident that we wonâ€™t cause any errors if we try to access these members in either the Sedan or Truck class.
