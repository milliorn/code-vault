Finish Truck Class
The car designers have asked that trucks act a bit differently from sedans. Trucks need a new property called Weight. Whenever a truck is constructed, its number of wheels will depend on its weight. For example, a heavier truck might need 12 instead of 8 wheels to support itself.

Just like sedans, trucks will also SpeedUp() and SlowDown().
