METHOD CALLS AND INPUT
Named Arguments
Say your method has lots of optional parameters, but you only want to specify one when you call it.

In this example, your method has five optional parameters:

static void YourMethodName(int a = 0, int b = 0, int c = 0, int d = 0, int e = 0) {...}
When you call the method, you only want to specify d. But calling the method this way would set a to 4, not d!

YourMethodName(4);
Refer to the parameter by its name instead:

YourMethodName(d: 4);
With named arguments, you can list them in any order:

YourMethodName(d: 4, b: 1, a: 2);
You can also mix them with positional arguments, but they MUST come before named arguments:

YourMethodName(2, 1, d: 4) // a is 2, b is 1, d is 4
YourMethodName(d: 4, 2, 1) // Error!
Named arguments arenâ€™t always necessary, but they can be useful when:

a method has many optional parameters
you want to differentiate between similar arguments
