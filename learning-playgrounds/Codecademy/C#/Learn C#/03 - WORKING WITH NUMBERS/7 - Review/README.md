WORKING WITH NUMBERS

Review

Great job! You just learned about numerical data types and how to work with numerical data in a few different ways:

Use arithmetic operators to write expressions.
Combine operators together to write more concise programs.
Use the modulo operator (%) to find remainders.
Use built-in methods to do more complex math.
Use documentation to look new things up.
Now that you know a few ways of working with numbers, try writing some small programs that use what you learned in this lesson. Some ideas:

Write a program that calculates compound interest
Write a program that finds your age in dog years
What other program ideas can you come up with?
