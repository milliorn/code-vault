WORKING WITH NUMBERS

Using Documentation

We introduced you to a few common built-in methods, but there are many more out there! Now’s a good time to practice your documentation search skills. Take a moment to look up the following built-in methods to understand their usage:

Math.Pow()
Math.Max()
Math.Ceiling()
(If you’re having trouble locating what you need, we recommend the Microsoft .NET API documentation).
