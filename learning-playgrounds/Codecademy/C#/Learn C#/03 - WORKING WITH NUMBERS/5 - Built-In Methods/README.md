WORKING WITH NUMBERS

Built-In Methods

So how do we do more advanced mathematical operations? For example, how would we perform a square root on a number if the program doesn’t recognize a square root symbol?

There are several built-in methods that we can use to manipulate numerical data and perform more complex mathematical calculations. Here are a few:

Math.Abs()—will find the absolute value of a number. Example: Math.Abs(-5) returns 5.
Math.Sqrt()—will find the square root of a number. Example: Math.Sqrt(16) returns 4.
Math.Floor()—will round the given double or decimal down to the nearest whole number. Example: Math.Floor(8.65) returns 8.
Math.Min()—returns the smaller of two numbers. Example: Math.Min(39, 12) returns 12.
