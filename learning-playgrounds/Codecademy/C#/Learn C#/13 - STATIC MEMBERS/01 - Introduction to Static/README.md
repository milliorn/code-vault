STATIC MEMBERS
Introduction to Static
At this point, you may recall:

A custom data type is defined by a class.
An instance of a class is called an object. Multiple, unique objects can be instantiated from one class.
This process of bundling related data and methods into a type is called encapsulation, and it makes code easier to organize and reuse.
What if we needed to do something related to the type itself, not instances of that type? For example, where do we store the count of all Forest objects, or an explanation of forests in general?

To keep with the rules of encapsulation, these shouldnâ€™t be associated with one instance (because this information is related to the Forest class, not a single Forest instance).

These facts and behaviors should be associated with the class itself! We call these types of members static.

This lesson will cover the meaning of static, how to apply it to different types of class members, and its typical uses cases.
