STATIC MEMBERS
Review
Congrats! You are now ready to use static throughout your classes:

In general, static means “associated with the class, not an instance”.
A static member is always accessed by the class name, rather than the instance name, like Forest.Area.
A static method cannot access non-static members.
A static constructor is run once per type, not per instance. It is invoked before the type is instantiated or a static member is accessed.
Either of these would trigger the static constructor of Forest:
public static void Main() {
  Forest f  = new Forest(); 
}
or

public static void Main() {
  Forest.Define(); 
}
A static class cannot be instantiated. Its members are accessed by the class name, like Math.PI.
