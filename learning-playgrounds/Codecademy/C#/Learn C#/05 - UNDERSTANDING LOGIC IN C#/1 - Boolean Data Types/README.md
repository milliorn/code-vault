UNDERSTANDING LOGIC IN C#

Boolean Data Types

In C#, we can represent Boolean values using the bool data type. Booleans, unlike numbers or strings, only have two values: true and false.

To define a variable as a boolean, you define the data type as bool. Then write the variable name and set it equal to the value, either true or false:

bool variableName = true;
The variable is named variableName, its of type bool, and its value is true.

While we use the words true and false to represent boolean values, itâ€™s important to remember that they are different from the strings "true" and "false".
