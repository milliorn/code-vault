ARRAYS
Array Length
We often want to know how many items an array contains. We can do this with the .Length property.

int[] plantHeights = { 3, 4, 6 };

// arrayLength will be 3
int arrayLength = plantHeights.Length 
Using the .Length property will return the number of items in an array and zero if the array is empty.
