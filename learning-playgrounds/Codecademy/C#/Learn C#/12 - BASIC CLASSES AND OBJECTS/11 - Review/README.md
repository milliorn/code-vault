BASIC CLASSES AND OBJECTS
Review
Congrats! You’ve finished a lot of content and some of the most important concepts in C#. When someone asks you, “How do I make a custom data type in C#?” you can talk all about it! In this lesson, you learned how to:

Define a class
Instantiate an object using new
Define fields, the pieces of data for each class
Define properties, the spokespeople for each field
Define automatic properties, the shorthand for making properties
Define methods, the actions a class can take
Define constructors, the special methods called when a class is instantiated
Overload constructors and reuse code with this
Control access to class members using public and private
