C# in the Wild

You’ve seen some examples of C# code in action, but learning a programming language is more than just memorizing commands: it’s understanding how it differs from other technologies, joining its community, and applying it to real-life problems. Here’s what you need to know:

C# technologies are fast: A software company called Raygun built their application using Node.js, a framework for JavaScript. When their app started to slow down, they switched to .NET, a framework for C#. Their performance skyrocketed. As CEO John Daniel puts it, “using the same size server, we were able to go from 1,000 requests per second…with Node.js, to 20,000 requests per second with .NET Core.” In other words, they increased throughput by 2,000%.

The C# community is big: In 2018, Github ranked C# as the sixth most popular programming language and StackOverflow ranked it eighth.

C# is employable: Thanks to good design and the popularity of frameworks supporting the language, C# can get you access to a lot of great jobs. Search on any job site and you’ll find companies looking for C# and .NET developers to build chat applications, financial trading programs, medical record systems, and beyond. In the 2019 HackerRank Developer Skills Report, expertise in two C#-compatible frameworks, ASP.NET and .NET Core, were among the top ten most sought-after by managers.
