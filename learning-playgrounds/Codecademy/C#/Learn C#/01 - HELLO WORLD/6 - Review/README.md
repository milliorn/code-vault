HELLO WORLD

Review

Congrats! You finished your first lesson in C#. In this lesson you learned:

C# is used to make interactive websites, mobile apps, video games, augmented and virtual reality (AR and VR), back-end services, and desktop applications
.NET generally refers to the family of programs and commands that let you make applications with C#
C# and .NET jobs are out there! Build video games with Unity, build websites with ASP.NET…The skills you learn on Codecademy can open new doors
The command Console.WriteLine() prints text to the console
The command Console.ReadLine() captures user input in the console
Comments are lines of code that are ignored by your computer; they’re intended to be read by developers instead. Make them with // or /* and */
Instructions
Here’s the first C# application we used earlier. Use Console.WriteLine() commands to make it your own!
