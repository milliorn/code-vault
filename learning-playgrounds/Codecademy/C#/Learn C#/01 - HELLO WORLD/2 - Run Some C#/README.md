HELLO WORLD

Run Some C#

Time to run some C# yourself!

There are two panels here: a text editor containing some C# code and a console, or terminal, that shows output. When you run the code, you’ll see some text printed to the console. 

The code is contained in a file called Program.cs. For now, just focus on the line: 

Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");

Console.WriteLine() is a command that prints text to a console. Whatever is in between the parentheses will be printed to the console!  In this case it’s Hello World!.
